#Â Bank tech test

This is a small self contained piece of code to simulate some of the core
functionality of a 'bank account'.

The functions are run from a REPL interface like IRB.

Code functions:
deposit(date, amount) - to create a deposit transaction
withdraw(date, amount) - to create a withdrawl transaction
statement_print - to print out a list of transactions in reverse date order

The functionality is to meet the requirements laid out in the Bank_tech_test challenge.
